# Push_Swap Fix Plan

## Phase 1: Indexing System Implementation
- [ ] Add index assignment function to utils.c
- [ ] Modify parse_input.c to assign indices during parsing
- [ ] Test indexing functionality

## Phase 2: Sorting Algorithm Overhaul
- [ ] Complete rewrite of sort_large.c with proper chunk-based algorithm
- [ ] Add proper median calculation function
- [ ] Implement efficient sorting for large stacks

## Phase 3: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test with various input sizes (2, 3, 4, 5, 6+ elements)
- [ ] Verify operations produce correct sorting
- [ ] Test edge cases and error handling

## Phase 4: Optimization (if needed)
- [ ] Optimize operation count
- [ ] Ensure compliance with project requirements

# push_swap
this is a new start of my journey on game and also algorithms, as i am doing push swap. This is a game where you are given two stack A &amp; B which has random values which could be positive and negative, we have to sort it in an ascending order with the shortest posible moves, did i forget to mention B is empty and you could use it to swap.
